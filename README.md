# Unpotted Reminder

### Description
This plugin reminds you to drink your boost potions when you are in combat and have a boost potion in your inventory. 
The overlay will go away once you drink a potion or after the customizable timeout.
You can configure a threshold where you will only be reminded once your stats fall below a certain level.

### Note
Defensive attack styles for ranged and magic are currently not supported, and defense is instead tracked as a melee skill 
for all intents and purposes. Magic is currently unable to differentiate between casting combat and non-combat skills and 
as such is **disabled by default**.
